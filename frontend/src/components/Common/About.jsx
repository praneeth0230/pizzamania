          In Pizzeria pizza usually falls into two categories:
          <br />
          thick and cheesy Chicago style or thin and more traditional
          Pizzeria pizza.
          <br />
          In Italy pizza also falls into two distinct categories: Italian pizza
          and the rest of the world.
